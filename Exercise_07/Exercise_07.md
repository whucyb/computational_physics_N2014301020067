# Exercise 07

* Problem 3.12.<br>
In constructing the Poincaré section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phase with the force; that is, at times ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%5Capprox%202%5Cpi%20n/%5COmega%20_D), where n is an interger. At these values of t the driving force passed throught zero [see (3.8)]. However, we could just as easily have chosen to make the plot at times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi/4) out-of-phase with this force, etc. Construct the Poincaré sections for these cases and compare them with Figure 3.9.

* Problem 3.13.<br>
Write a program to calculate and compare the brhavior of two, nearly indentical pedulums. Use it to calculate the divergence of two nearby trajectories in the chaotic regime, as in Figure 3.7, and make a qualitative estimate of the corresponding Lyapunov exponent from the slope of a plot of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?log%28%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta%20%29) as a function of t.

* Problem 3.14.<br>
Repeat the previous problem, but give the two pendulums slightly different damping factors. How does the value of the Lyapunov exponent compare with that found in Figure 3.7?
